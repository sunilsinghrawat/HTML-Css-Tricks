/*set media query according your device		
@media(max-width:380px){
			element{height:100dvh;}

The new Viewport Units are that solution:
100svh refers to 100% of the height of the smallest possible viewport.
100lvh refers to 100% of the height of the largest possible viewport.
100dvh refers to 100% of the dynamic viewport height â€” meaning the value will change as the user scrolls.
